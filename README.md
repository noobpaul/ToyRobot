# ToyRobot
Coding challenge for AIM Employment

This is a starter project just to showcase my skill on research and my versatility in terms of learning something new which also aligns with the given business requirements.

This application runs on Unity Environment. If you want to build it, please see Unity Hub Installation and corresponding Microsoft Visual Studio installation at https://dotnet.microsoft.com/en-us/learn/games/unity-tutorial/intro which uses dotnet as its main programming language.

Thanks! :)
